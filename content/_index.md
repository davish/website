**Hi there!** I'm Davis, a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying
Computer Science. I'm really passionate about software engineering, elections and
learning new things.

I spend a lot of my time building open source products for Penn students at
[Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org). This summer, I'm working at **Amazon Robotics**
as a Software Development Intern.
