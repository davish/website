**Hi there!** I'm Davis, a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying
Computer Science. I'm really passionate about software engineering, spaceflight and elections.

I spend a lot of my time building open source products for Penn students at
[Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org). Starting in the fall, I'll be working at **MongoDB**
as a Software Engineer.
