I just signed my second lease since moving to New York City after college, and some friends asked me for advice on how to find an apartment here. I didn't realize at first how many opinions I have on the whole process, and thought that I might as well write down my thoughts.

The tl;dr is that this process is all about tradeoffs, mostly between time and money. If you're willing to spend more time seeing apartments in person, then you're much more likely to find a great apartment that others are overlooking because the information online is incomplete or hard to find. If you're willing to spend more money or give up something that most other renters are looking for, you can find a nicer apartment without searching for a diamond in the rough. 

If you can put in the time to develop an intuition for the types of apartments on the market in your budget, you'll be much more confident in your decision when you ultimately sign a lease.

NYC's rental market is famously crazy, and the disruptions brought by COVID-19 haven't made it any less so. Lots of people were able to negotiate their rent downward or sign new leases with attractive deals during 2020 and the first few months of 2021, but since last summer, rents have [bounced back and then some](https://www.globest.com/2021/08/25/new-york-passes-san-francisco-as-the-most-expensive-rental-market/?slreturn=20220404122002). Many tenants have since been priced out of their current apartments, which only adds to how much demand there is in the market right now.

New York is a huge city, and I'm an early-career software engineer who works in Midtown Manhattan looking for apartments in lower Manhattan and adjacent parts of Brooklyn. I also happen to be a bit of a recovering HGTV junkie who enjoys looking at floorplans more than is probably healthy. I can't expect this post to cover everyone's rental experience, but hopefully there's some small bits of advice you can pull from it.

## When to begin your search
The first listings will start being posted about 1.5 months before the move-in date, but some come up with as little as a week to go until move-in. It can be really useful to start looking at the apartments that are available in the month before your target move. This helps you understand what's on the market in your price range and develop the intuition to spot a good deal when it presents itself. 

## Start on StreetEasy
How do you even find apartments that are available to rent? [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com) is your best friend. It's a listing website exclusive to NYC where brokers generally post all their listings. You can create an account and save searches to come back to and get email updates for. 

I recommend taking a visit to the "Email Preferences" section of your account settings. I set all my searches to send emails once per day, and also I checked the setting to combine all the searches into one email. This meant that every morning I'd get a digest of all the new apartments that were listed within our price range and desired locations. 

I got into the habit of checking this email every morning before work, and clicking the "Request a Tour" button on every listing that was interesting to me. Brokers generally reach out with a day or two.

## Beyond StreetEasy
StreetEasy makes it super easy to find listings and contact listing agents, but it isn't the whole process. Forming too much of an opinion based off a StreetEasy listing can lead you to miss out on a great apartment.

The listing for my first apartment only had a photo for one out of four bedrooms in the apartment. The listing for the second apartment *had no photos of the apartment itself*, just photos of the shared rooftop and the mail room. In both cases, the listing agents weren't trying to hide anything. They just didn't have the opportunity to take photos of the apartment while tenants were still living there and were working with old and incomplete photos.

My second apartment was far-and-away better than others I'd seen but had an order of magnitude fewer "likes" on StreetEasy.  Only one other group showed up to the open house, compared to the dozens of people I had seen at a very well-photographed apartment around the corner a few weeks before.

**Don't be afraid of going to listings without many photos**! Sometimes agents just haven't been able to take them yet, and you'll be able to see a place before others start taking it seriously. It's still important do your due dilligence. Check out the building on Street View or walk by in person if it's convenient for you. I also would **NOT** recommend signing a lease without any pictures at all if you're not able to visit in person.

In a similar vein, I have a friend who lives in Boston who rented his apartment off of Craigslist, which lots of people consider a less legitimate website. He was able to find a great apartment that others were discounting for more superficial reasons.

## Talk to listing agents
When you visit an apartment, make sure to talk to the  agent and let them know what you're looking for. It's pretty likely they'll be trying to rent out other apartments, and sometimes, they'll show you places that haven't been listed yet. Ultimately, real estate agents earn their income on commission, and so they'll do what they can to help you find an apartment where they can get the broker's fee. Getting sneak previews like this is a great way to get a head start on other renters.

### Asking questions
It's important to ask questions to the listing agent about the apartment while you're touring. Here are some that I've found useful or illuminating. 

- What utilities are included and which are my responsibility to pay for?
- Does the super live in the building?
- [If there isn't central air conditioning] are A/C units included or will I need to buy and bring my own?
- [If you want to apply] What will the application process look like?

## Applying

Once you find an apartment you like, the next step is to apply! Tenant rights are strong in New York, so landlords do a lot of due dilligence to make sure you can really pay rent before drawing up a lease for you to sign. 

My main advice through the application process is to be as responsive as possible and be honest with the leasing agent and the landlord. Before you sign the lease there's nothing legally requiring them to continue working with you, so getting requested documents to them as quickly as you can is important. It's also a good way to make a positive first impression on the people that may be your future landlord.

I've encountered two types of application:

- Some listings require an application deposit that can be anywhere from $500 to month's worth of rent. This fee is refunded if your application is rejected by the landlord. While it might seem really burdensome to give up money before even having a lease to sign, the apartment will generally be taken off the market while your application is being evaluated by the landlord. This is great when you find a place you really like â€“ it means that you don't need to worry about competing offers, or other renters applying who are more attractive tenants for whatever reason.
- This most recent search, I ran into a lot of applications that didn't require a fee. Instead, the landlord collected as many applications as came in after an open house, and picked the one they like the best. This seems nice because there's no upfront cost but there's generally more waiting since the landlord has more applications to read, and there's no guarantee that you'll get the apartment even if you have a great application.

## Signing the lease
Once you've been approved for an application, it's time to sign a lease! I don't really have many opinions on this part of the process. I'm also certainly not a lawyer, but one thing I will say is make sure to actually read your lease! Even if you don't want to negotiate anything inside of it, it is always good to know what you're signing.
