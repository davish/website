description: >
  Intern on the Query team, which designs and maintains the implementation of the MongoDB Query
  Language, including query planning and optimization and the aggregation framework.
---

- Worked on query analysis features and implemented end-to-end integration tests for the GA
  release of Field Level Encryption, a new feature enabling end-to-end encryption on the database
  driver level rather than the application itself. This was critical to ensuring customer
  data was not leaked through the encryption layer.

- Took ownership over the design specification for how to execute JavaScript for MapReduce
  jobs inside of MongoDB's aggregation framework.
